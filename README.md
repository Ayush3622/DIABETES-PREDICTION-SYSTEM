Developed a machine learning model for diabetes prediction using the KNN, Random Forest , Support 
Vector Classifier. Preprocessed data by handling missing values and scaling features. Visualized data 
distributions and correlations with Seaborn and Matplotlib. Evaluated model performance through 
confusion matrices and classification reports
